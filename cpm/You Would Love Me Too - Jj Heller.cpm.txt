[C]We could [G]talk for [Am]hours
 
It doesn't [F]matter
 
You don't [Am]hear a word I [G]say
 
'Cause [C]you don't [G]listen when I [Am]speak

 
So I'll [F]sing [G] [C]instead

 
[Am]La la la la la I love yo[C]u
 
[E7]Ooh I really [Am]do [G] 
 
[F]If you ever paid attentio[C]n
 
I think [F]you wo[G]uld love me [Am]too

 [F] [G]

You say you want to know me
I get the feeling that you're telling me a lie
'Cause every time I talk about emotion
You shake your pretty head and say goodbye

[Am] [C]
La la la la la I love you
[E7] [Am] [G]
Ooh I really do
[F] [C]
If you ever paid attention
 [F] [G] [F]
I think you would love me

[C] [G]
Why do I love you like I do
 [F]
When you ignore me
[C] [G] [Am] [C] [F]
Just like the sun ignores the moon
[Dm] [G] [Am]
All you see is you

 [C]
I love you
[E7] [Am] [G]
Ooh sad but true
[F] [C]
If you ever paid attention
 [F] [G] [F]
I think you would love me too

 [F]
I love you
[E7] [Am]
Ooh I really do
[F] [C]
If you ever paid attention
 [F] [G] [Am]
I think you would love me too
[G] [F]
Love me too
[G] [Am] [G] [F]
Love me too
