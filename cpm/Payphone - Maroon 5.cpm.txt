I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby It's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
{comment: Rap A} 
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

{comment: Bridge} 
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now i'm paralyzed
Still stucked in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby It's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song i'll be sick
Oh

{comment:Rap B} 
You turned your back on tomorrow
Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know i've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

Now fuck that shit
I'll be right here spending all this money while you sitting round
Wondering why it wasn't you who came out from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me i'm stunning
And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show
You can tell it i'm balling
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw
But sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled out valet open doors
Wiz like go way, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you
