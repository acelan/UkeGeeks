[G] Almost heaven [Em]West Virginia
[D]Blue Ridge Mountain [C]Shenandoah [G]River
[G]Life is old there
[Em]Older than the trees
[D]Younger than the mountains
[C]Growing like a [G]breeze


{comment: 主歌 B}
[G] All my memories [Em]Gather round her
[D] Miner's Lady [C]Stranger to blue [G]water
[G]Dark and dusty [Em]Painted on the sky
[D]Misty taste of moonshine [C]Tear drops in my [G]eyes

{comment: 主歌C}
[Em]I hear her [D]voice in the [G]morning hours She calls me
The [C]radio [G]reminds me of my [D]home far away
And [Em]driving down the [F]road
I'll get a [C]feeling That I [G]should have been home
[D]Yesterday
