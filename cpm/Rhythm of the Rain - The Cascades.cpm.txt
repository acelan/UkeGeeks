{comment: 主歌 A}
[C]Listen to the rhythm of the [F]falling rain 
[C]Telling me just what a fool I’ve [G7]been
I [C]wish that it would go and let me [F]cry in vain
And [C]let me be [G7]alone ag[C]ain

{comment: 主歌 B}
The [C]only girl I care about has [F]gone away 
Looking [C]for a brand new [G7]start
But [C]little does she know that when she [F]left that day
Along [C]with her she [G7]took my [C]heart [C7]
