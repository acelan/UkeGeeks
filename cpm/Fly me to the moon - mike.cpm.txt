[Am]Fly me to the [Dm]moon
And let me [G7]sing among the [Cmaj7]stars[C7]
[F]Let me see what [Dm]Spring is like
On [E7]Jupiter and [Am]Mars[A7]
In [Dm]other words,[G7] hold my [Em]hand![A7]
In [Dm]other words,[G7] darling, [Bm]kiss me![E7]
[Am]Fill my heart with [Dm]song
And let me [G7]sing forever[Cmaj7]more[C7]
[F]You are all I [Dm]long for
All I [E7]worship and [Am]adore[A7]
In [Dm]other words,[G7] please be [Em]true![A7]
In [Dm]other words,[G7] I love [C]you![Fm]  [C]
