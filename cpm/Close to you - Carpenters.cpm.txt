Why do [F]birds suddenly [E]appear
Every[Em]time you are [Am]near?
[F]Just like me, they long to be
[C]Close to you
Why [F]stars fall down from the [E]sky
Every[Em]time you walk [Am]by?
[F]Just like me, they long to be
[C]Close to you 
{comment: B 段} 
[F]On the day that you were born
The angels got together
They [Em]decided to create a dream come [A]true
So they [F]sprinkled moon dust in your hair
And put a starlight in your eyes so [G]blue
{comment: C 段} 
That is [F]why all the girls in [E]town
Follow [Em]you, all [Am]around
[F]Just like me, they long to be
[C]Close to you
