{comment: 主歌} 
Twenty-five years and my life is still
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
And I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes
When I m lying in bed
Just to get it all out
What s in my head
And I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream at the top of my lungs
What s going on?

And I say, hey hey hey hey
I said hey, what s going on?
And I say, hey hey hey hey
I said hey, what s going on?
Ooh, ooh ooh
{comment:主歌 } 
and I try, oh my god do I try
I try all the time, in this institution
And I pray, oh my god do I pray
I pray every single day
For a revolution
