Every breaking [C]wave on the [Em]shore

Tells the [G]next one there’ll be one [D]more

And every gambler [C]knows that to [Em]lose

Is what [G]you’re really there [D]for 
 
Summer I was [C]fearless [Em]
 
Now I [G]speak into an answer [D]phone
 
Like every falling [C]leaf on the [Em]breeze
 
Winter [G]wouldn’t leave it [D]alone. [D]Alone

If you go[C]? [Em] If you go [G]your way and I go [D]mine
 
Are we so[C]? [Em] Are we so [G]helpless against the [D]tide?
 
Baby every [C]dog on the [Em]street
 
Knows that we’re in [G] love with [D]defeat
 
Are we ready to [C]be swept off our [Em]feet

And stop [G]chasing
 
[D]Every breaking [C]wave

Every sailor knows that the sea
Is a friend made enemy
And every shipwrecked soul
